  description: >
    Conduct a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset. 
    Use the tools in the following strict sequence to ensure consistent insights:

    1. **Use `load_data_tool`** to load the dataset from the provided file path.
    2. **Use `missing_value_analysis_tool`** to inspect and summarize missing data patterns.
    3. **Use `univariate_analysis_tool`** to analyze distributions of each numeric and categorical column.
    4. **Use `correlation_analysis_tool`** to find relationships between numeric variables and generate correlation heatmap.
    5. **Use `outlier_detection_tool`** to detect and summarize outliers using statistical methods.
    6. **Use `target_relationship_tool`** to analyze relationships between predictors and the target variable (if specified).
    7. **Use `generate_visualizations_tool`** to create comprehensive supporting charts and plots.
    8. **Use `export_report_tool`** to compile all findings into a structured report format.

    Dataset file path: {dataset_path}
    Target column (if specified): {target_column}
    
    Strict adherence to the tool sequence is required. Summarize each tool's output and provide insights.
    Focus on actionable business insights and data quality issues.

  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive EDA summary containing all findings including missing values, univariate analysis,
    correlation analysis, outlier detection, target relationships, and visualizations. 
    The analysis should be ready for display in the Streamlit frontend and include:
    
    1. Dataset overview (shape, columns, data types)
    2. Missing value analysis with recommendations
    3. Univariate analysis findings for all variables
    4. Correlation analysis with key relationships identified
    5. Outlier detection results and impact assessment
    6. Target variable relationships (if applicable)
    7. Key visualizations and their interpretations
    8. Overall data quality assessment
    9. Actionable recommendations for data preprocessing
    10. Business insights derived from the analysis
    
    All information should be stored in analysis_results for frontend display and PDF generation.
    The output should be well-structured with clear sections and ready for Streamlit interface.
